@article{Tromer2010,
	abstract = {We describe several software side-channel attacks based on inter-process leakage through the state of the CPU's memory cache. This leakage reveals memory access patterns, which can be used for cryptanalysis of cryptographic primitives that employ data-dependent table lookups. The attacks allow an unprivileged process to attack other processes running in parallel on the same processor, despite partitioning methods such as memory protection, sandboxing, and virtualization. Some of our methods require only the ability to trigger services that perform encryption or MAC using the unknown key, such as encrypted disk partitions or secure network links. Moreover, we demonstrate an extremely strong type of attack, which requires knowledge of neither the specific plaintexts nor ciphertexts and works by merely monitoring the effect of the cryptographic process on the cache. We discuss in detail several attacks on AES and experimentally demonstrate their applicability to real systems, such as OpenSSL and Linux's dm-crypt encrypted partitions (in the latter case, the full key was recovered after just 800 writes to the partition, taking 65 milliseconds). Finally, we discuss a variety of countermeasures which can be used to mitigate such attacks.},

	abstract = {This paper describes several novel timing attacks against the common table-driven software implementation of the AES cipher. We define a general attack strategy using a simplified model of the cache to predict timing variation due to cache-collisions in the sequence of lookups performed by the encryption. The attacks presented should be applicable to most high-speed software AES implementations and computing platforms, we have implemented them against OpenSSL v. 0.9.8.(a) running on Pentium III, Pentium IV Xeon, and UltraSPARC III+ machines. The most powerful attack has been shown under optimal conditions to reliably recover a full 128-bit AES key with 213 timing samples, an improvement of almost four orders of magnitude over the best previously published attacks of this type [Ber05]. While the task of defending AES against all timing attacks is challenging, a small patch can significantly reduce the vulnerability to these specific attacks with no performance penalty.},

@inproceedings{powerdraw,
	abstract = {This paper presents a new attack against a software implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard. The attack aims at flushing elements of the SBOX from the cache, thus inducing a cache miss during the encryption phase. The power trace is then used to detect when the cache miss occurs; if the miss happens in the first round of the AES then the information can be used to recover part of the secret key. The attack has been simulated using the Wattch simulation framework and a simple software implementation of AES (using a single table for the SBOX). The attack can be easily extended to more sophisticated versions of AES with more than one table. Eventually, we present a simple countermeasure which does not require randomization.},

We define a notion of differential q-multicollision and show that for AES-256 q-multicollisions can be constructed in time q{\textperiodcentered}267 and with negligible memory, while we prove that the same task for an ideal cipher of the same block size would require at least {\$}O(q{\backslash}cdot 2^{\{}{\backslash}frac{\{}q-1{\}}{\{}q+1{\}}128{\}}){\$}time. Using similar approach and with the same complexity we can also construct q-pseudo collisions for AES-256 in Davies-Meyer mode, a scheme which is provably secure in the ideal-cipher model. We have also computed partial q-multicollisions in time q{\textperiodcentered}237 on a PC to verify our results. These results show that AES-256 can not model an ideal cipher in theoretical constructions. Finally we extend our results to find the first publicly known attack on the full 14-round AES-256: a related-key distinguisher which works for one out of every 235 keys with 2120 data and time complexity and negligible memory. This distinguisher is translated into a key-recovery attack with total complexity of 2131 time and 265 memory.},
